udp_client

This project was build on top of code given by Sarvesh Kulkarni. 

Created function that performs a checksum on given input array and size. Wrote code to recieve a file using UDP and reorder it based on 
file number. Finally it runs the checksum on the file to ensure there are no errors. If none it writes to a file based on the name sent, 
otherwise it will request a retransmission from the server.
